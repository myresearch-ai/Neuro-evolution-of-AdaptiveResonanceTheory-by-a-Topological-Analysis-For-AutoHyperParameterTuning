### Neuro Evolution of Neural-Networks: Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) case study
This is a growing repository demonstrating the application of evolutionary algorithms to evolve neural networks. Neural networks are difficult to train, discoverining the right combination of hyperparameters for a given problem particulalry where domain knowledge is lacking is challenging. Why not apply evolutionary principles leading to evolutionary pressures that allow the discovery of the optimal organization or architecture of a neural network including its configuration?
