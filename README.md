# **Neuro Evolution of Neural-Networks: Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) case study** 

Overview:
---

Neural networks including **deep learning** have numerous hyperparameters that are critical to the network's performance, **Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)** - A class of **self-organizing maps (MAPs)** that are brain-inspired are no exception. ART is a theory about how advanced primate brains learn to adapt & recognize objects & events in a dynamic world. The various forms of ART that have been developed continue to denonstrate exceptional performance on complex tasks requiring neural network systems that are self-adapting. However, selecting suitable configuration of the network's parameters such as **vigilance** is often done empirically in an ad hoc manner. Various methods in isolated efforts have been applied to adapt these parameters (e.g vigilance adaptation) in response to changes in the environment as the network learns internal representations via long-term memory traces while interacting with the environment. This project applies **genetic algorithms (GA)**- a subclass of **evolutionary algorithms (EC)** to apply principles of evolution to evolve an ART network specifically, **Fuzzy ARTMAP**. Integrating evolutionary methods to biologically plausible networks seems to be natural conceptually in that both are inspired by biological evolution to environmentally successful behaviors. I claim so because "brain evolution is shaped by behavioral success" [Stephen Grossberg](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2021/stephen-grossberg-conscious-mind-resonant-brain/) & EC in principle  applies evolutionary pressures leading to most successful behaviors.
